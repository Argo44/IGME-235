            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>
                I'm Alex, a 2nd year GDD student at RIT, and I want to use my time in college to learn
                as much as I possibly can about all sorts of subjects. Through my major, I want to
                develop and master the necessary skills for game development, but I also want to build
                a solid toolset for general media development, as well as improving my artistic skills.
                I hope that I can come out of this class with a good sense for creating and analyzing
                web applications, and I hope that I can use my time at RIT to meet <em>all sorts</em> 
                of people and soak in as much knowledge as I <em>possibly</em> can!
            </p>

                    I created my own <strong>personal portfolio</strong> using HTML and CSS
                    so I can easily share my work with others or potential employers:

                    I designed my own <strong>web application</strong> with a local storage
                    and user controls, built on an API of my choice:

                    I created a complete <strong>web-based game</strong> driven by JavaScript,
                    with sound and several advanced features:
