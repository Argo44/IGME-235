# Game Ideas

* ASCII-style mini adventure
* "Upgrader" game (inspired by old favorite on Kongregate: wave shooter game focused on upgrading everything)
* Platformer w/ mouse interactions (mouse has to click on game objects, player needs to move ingame character to help mouse access tools)
* Simple Battle RPG
